## Project Description

I was tasked with restructuring the Learning and Performance Research Center (LPRC) lab website using Wordpress. The goal was to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing website that would be easier to navigate and maintain, bringing the old site up to code with new WSU web design standards. I worked with the LPRC team to identify the key features and content that needed to be included on the website, and then designed and developed the site using Wordpress, WSU's web backend platform of choice at the time. The new site is fully responsive and optimized for search engines. The LPRC team is now able to easily update and maintain the site themselves, and the new design has received positive feedback from users. 

## Showcase

Below is a side by side comparison of landing pages of the old website to the new website.

I also created new icons and graphics to be used for the different labs that the LPRC operates. These icons were created using Affinity Designer and are used throughout the site as badges to represent the different labs.
